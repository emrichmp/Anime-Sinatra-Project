**Description!**
Welcome! Here is a Sinatra based web app that was created for Users to express how they feel about the Animes they have watched! Here Users will be able to create entries where they input the name, favorite character and their rating of the anime (scale 1-10)! This is usefull because many Anime watchers love to have their list of watched shows written down along with their rating so they can look back at it later and remember all the shows they have watched! This Web app is designed to do just that!

**Installation!**
To install and run, just exec "bundle install" in the terminal! If that does not work you may have to run "bundle u" to update the Gems in the Gemfile. After that run "rackup" in the terminal. Then navigate to "http://localhost:9292" and you are ready to go!

**A Contributors Guide!**
Login or sign up in at the home page and you'll be able to see all your animes and their associated data. You can navigate around to Create, Delete and Edit/Update your animes! You can see your animes and anime entries made from other users. After you are satisfied with what you've done, you may click on "sign out" to log out of your account until you want to start up again.
